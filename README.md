[This chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advent%20/fpgpinpnmmgakjgadibllhngdapbhlad) modifies [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) puzzle titles by replacing leading and trailing dash padding `---` with hyperlinks to the previous day and next day puzzles to aid navigation.

For example, consider this title from the [2015 event](http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/16):

	--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---

After applying the modifications below the above title now reads:

	[--] Day 16: Aunt Sue [++]

The `[--]` and `[++]` will have become hyperlinks to the [Day 15](http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/15) and [Day 17](http://adventofcode.com/2015/day/17) puzzles, respectively. Enjoy!
